# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

SlugSwap is a mobile app that helps university students share dining points. Donors contribute to a shared weekly pool; requesters draw from a weekly allowance via short-lived claim codes generated through the school's GET Tools API.

The product spec lives in `slugswap-release.md`. It defines user stories, release strategy (Releases 0–3), KPIs, and prioritization framework. Treat it as the source of truth for product requirements.

## Commands

### Development
```bash
npm run mobile:start          # Start Expo dev server (mobile app)
npm run mobile:ios             # Run on iOS simulator
npm run mobile:android         # Run on Android emulator
npm run dashboard:dev          # Start Next.js dashboard (port 3000)
npm run dashboard:dev -- -p 3001  # Dashboard on custom port (useful when mobile needs 3000)
```

### Database (Drizzle)
```bash
npm run db:generate            # Generate migrations from schema changes
npm run db:push                # Push schema directly to Neon (no migration files)
npm run db:studio              # Open Drizzle Studio GUI
```

### Type Checking & CI
```bash
npm run typecheck              # All workspaces (root + dashboard + mobile)
npm run dashboard:typecheck    # Dashboard only
npm run mobile:typecheck       # Mobile only
npm run ci:check               # Same as typecheck (used in CI)
```

### Deployment
```bash
npm run dashboard:deploy       # Vercel preview deployment
npm run dashboard:deploy:prod  # Vercel production deployment
npm run mobile:eas:testflight  # Build iOS + submit to TestFlight
npm run mobile:eas:update      # OTA update to production channel
```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
npx expo-doctor                # Check for dependency issues, version mismatches, and configuration problems
```

Run `expo-doctor` when you encounter build errors or after upgrading packages to validate the setup.

No test framework is configured. No linter is configured.

## Architecture

### Monorepo Structure (npm workspaces)
- `apps/mobile/` — Expo Router (React Native) mobile app
- `apps/dashboard/` — Next.js 15 App Router: admin dashboard UI **and** all API routes
- `db/` — Drizzle ORM schema (`schema.ts`), migrations, and DB connection (`index.ts`)
- `lib/` — Shared client-side code (Supabase client, auth context, mobile API client)
- `packages/` — Empty (reserved for future shared packages)

### API Layer
All API routes live in `apps/dashboard/app/api/`. They use a **dynamic route segment + dispatcher** pattern:

```
apps/dashboard/app/api/[resource]/[action]/route.ts
```

Each route file exports HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) that all call a single `dispatch()` function. The dispatcher switches on the `action` param to call handler functions. Server-only utilities live in `apps/dashboard/lib/server/`.

API route groups: `donations`, `claims`, `requesters`, `users`, `admin`, `get` (GET Tools integration), `health`.

### Database
- **Drizzle ORM** with **Neon serverless** HTTP driver (`neon-http`)
- Schema in `db/schema.ts`, config in `drizzle.config.ts` (root)
- Tables: `users`, `donations`, `weeklyPools`, `claimCodes`, `redemptions`, `userAllowances`, `getCredentials`
- Connection created in `db/index.ts`; also mirrored in `apps/dashboard/lib/server/db.ts` for server-side use

### Auth
- **Mobile**: Supabase Auth with Google OAuth → session stored in AsyncStorage. `AuthProvider` in `lib/auth-context.tsx` manages global state and navigation guards.
- **Dashboard**: Supabase OAuth login → server validates via service role key → HMAC-signed session cookie (`slugswap_admin_session`). Admin access restricted by `ADMIN_EMAIL_ALLOWLIST` env var.
- **GET Tools**: PIN-based device auth. PINs encrypted with AES-256-GCM (`GET_CREDENTIAL_SECRET`), stored in `getCredentials` table.

### Mobile App Navigation
Expo Router file-based routing:
- `app/_layout.tsx` — Root layout with `AuthProvider`
- `app/auth/sign-in.tsx` — Google OAuth login
- `app/auth/callback.tsx` — OAuth callback handler
- `app/(tabs)/donor.tsx` — Donor screen (set contribution, link GET account, view impact)
- `app/(tabs)/requester.tsx` — Requester screen (generate claim codes, PDF417 barcode, history)

Mobile API client (`lib/api.ts`) injects Supabase bearer tokens into all requests.

### Key Domain Flow: Claim Code Lifecycle
1. Requester hits `/api/claims/generate`
2. Server finds active donor with linked GET credentials
3. Calls GET API `retrievePatronBarcodePayload` for a live barcode
4. Stores code in DB with 60-second expiry
5. Mobile renders as PDF417 barcode, auto-refreshes every 5 seconds
6. Code redeemed at GET terminal or expires

## Environment Setup

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values. Key groups:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` / `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — Supabase client
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — Server-side Supabase calls
- `DATABASE_URL` — Neon Postgres connection string
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` — Mobile → API base URL (default `http://localhost:3000`)
- `GET_*` — GET Tools API credentials and encryption secret
- `ADMIN_EMAIL_ALLOWLIST` / `ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET` — Dashboard admin auth

## Post-Change Actions

After making changes, always tell the user what they need to do to give the changes effect. Common actions:

- **Schema changes** (`db/schema.ts` or `apps/dashboard/lib/server/schema.ts`): Run `npm run db:push` to apply to Neon
- **Server / API changes** (`apps/dashboard/`): Run `npm run dashboard:deploy` (preview) or `npm run dashboard:deploy:prod` (production) to deploy to Vercel
- **Mobile changes** (`apps/mobile/`): Run `npm run mobile:eas:update` for OTA update, or `npm run mobile:eas:testflight` for a new build
- **Environment variable changes**: Update `.env` locally and/or set in Vercel dashboard / EAS secrets
- **New dependencies**: Run `npm install` from the repo root

If a change spans multiple layers (e.g. schema + API + mobile), list all required steps in order. Never assume the user knows what to run — always be explicit.

## Prioritization (from product spec)

When making implementation decisions, follow this order:
1. User trust and fairness first
2. Redemption reliability second
3. Onboarding speed third
4. Visual polish after core reliability is stable
